Potential Improvements
1.Support for Multiple Excel Formats
Extend the application to support .xlsx files using libraries like openpyxl, in addition to the current .xls support with xlrd.

2.Dynamic Excel Upload
Implement an endpoint (e.g., /upload_excel) to allow users to upload Excel files dynamically at runtime, eliminating the dependency on a hardcoded file path.

3.Advanced Filtering and Search
Add support for partial or fuzzy matching of row names to improve usability when working with inconsistent or lengthy data entries.

4.Table Summary Endpoint
Include an endpoint that returns metadata for a selected table, such as the number of rows and columns, presence of numeric vs non-numeric data, and missing value statistics.

5.User Interface Integration
Consider building a minimal frontend (using frameworks like React or Vue) to provide a graphical interface for uploading files, selecting tables, and computing row sums.

6.Data Validation and Error Handling
Add stricter data validation to check for consistent formatting, expected headers, and enforce row uniqueness where applicable.

Missed Edge Cases
1.Empty or Malformed Sheets
The application does not currently check for empty tables or tables that may not contain a valid structure. This may lead to IndexError or invalid outputs.

2.Non-Numeric Row Values
If a specified row contains strings or other non-numeric values, these are silently ignored in the sum. The API could provide a warning or detailed breakdown of ignored values.

3.Duplicate Row Names
The current implementation returns the first matching row. If multiple rows have the same label, subsequent values are ignored.

4.String Formatting
Minor inconsistencies in whitespace or punctuation in row_name (e.g., trailing = or double spaces) can cause valid rows to be missed.

5.Case Sensitivity
The table and row name comparisons are case-sensitive. Allowing case-insensitive matching could improve user experience.

6.Missing or Moved Excel File
If the file is moved or deleted from the expected Data/ directory, the API fails. Adding a more graceful fallback or upload mechanism would improve reliability.
